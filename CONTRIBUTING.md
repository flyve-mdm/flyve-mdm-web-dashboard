## <a name="4.2"></a> 4.2 How to Create a Pull Request (PR).

Before submitting your Pull Request check for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. We don't want to duplicate efforts.

### <a name="4.2.1"></a> 4.2.1 Create a Branch

Create a new branch before committing any changes. A _branch is a parallel version of a repository._ It is contained within the repository but does not affect the **`primary or master` branch**. Name it anything _except master, develop, release-*, or hotfix-*_. For the educational purpose in our examples, we'll use **`created-branch`**.

:no_entry_sign: **Important:** Do not commit to our default **`develop`** branch.

### <a name="4.2.2"></a> 4.2.2 Make Changes


Make your changes in your **newly created** branch, the project is organized according to the branch model [Git Flow.](http://git-flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

```console
    git checkout -b created-branch develop
```

### <a name="4.2.3"></a> 4.2.3 Commit Your Changes
A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep a record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.

### <a name="4.2.3.1"></a> 4.2.3.1 Rules to Follow
For commits, we follow the [Conventional Commit](http://conventionalcommits.org/). This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also, we use the git commit messages to **automatically generate changelogs** from these messages.

### <a name="4.2.3.2"></a> 4.2.3.2 Commit Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **description**:

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>
<BLANK LINE>
<optional body>
<BLANK LINE>
<optional footer>
```

### <a name="4.2.3.2.1"></a> 4.2.3.2.1 Header: Writting a `<type>`. 
Commits must be prefixed with a type, which consists of a verb, **feat, fix, build,** followed by a colon and space.

**Your options:**

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
* **docs**: Documentation only changes.
* **feat**: A new feature.
* **fix**: A bug fix.
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature.
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.

---
>**Example for `<type>`:**
>:point_right:feat:point_left:(parser): add ability to parse arrays
---

### <a name="4.2.3.2.2"></a> 4.2.3.2.2 Header: Writting the (`<optional scope>`).
A scope (optional) may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained in parenthesis.

---
> **Example for a (`<optional scope>`):**
> feat:point_right:(parser):point_left:: add ability to parse arrays 
---

### <a name="4.2.3.2.3"></a> 4.2.3.2.3 Header: Writting a `<description>`
A description must immediately follow the **`<type>(<optional scope>):`** The description is a short description of the pull request.

**Important**
* Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
* Don't capitalize the first letter.
* Do not use a dot (.) at the end.

---
>**Example for `<description>`**:
>feat(parser)::point_right:add ability to parse arrays:point_left:
---

### <a name="4.2.3.2.4"></a> 4.2.3.2.4 Header Lenght
The **header** cannot be longer than 100 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### <a name="4.2.3.2.5"></a> 4.2.3.2.5 Writting the `<optional body>`.
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

---
>**Example for `<optional body>`**:
```
fix orthography
remove out of date paragraph
fix broken links
```
---

### <a name="4.2.3.2.6"></a> 4.2.3.2.6 Writting the `<optional footer>`.
The `<optional footer>` should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) if any.

For example, to close an issue numbered **`123`**, you could use the phrases **`Closes #123`** in your pull request description or commit message. Once the branch is merged into the default branch, the issue will close.

---
>**Example for `<optional footer>`**:
>:point_right:Closes #123:point_left:
---

### <a name="4.2.3.3 "></a> 4.2.3.3 Commit Examples
:shit:
**Bad**

```console
docs(readme): fix orthography, remove out of date paragraph and fix broken links
```
:+1:
**Good**

```console
docs(readme): document design improvement change content

fix orthography
remove out of date paragraph
fix broken links
```

### <a name="4.2.4"></a> 4.2.4 Push your Changes
Pushing refers to **sending your committed changes to a remote repository**, such as a repository hosted on GitHub. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.

After working on your changes you need to Push it (upload) your **newly created branch** to GitHub

```console
    git push origin created-branch
```

### <a name="4.2.5"></a> 4.2.5 Create a Pull Request

Pull requests or PR are **proposed changes** to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.

After all the work being pushed to the newly created branch, In GitHub, send a pull request to our [repository.](https://github.com/flyve-mdm/legacy-web-dashboard/pulls)

### <a name="4.2.5.1"></a> 4.2.5.1 How to Write a Title for a Pull Request.
Pull Request should be named in reference to the main fix or feature you provide, minor information can be added to the description.

:straight_ruler:
**Title Lenght:** Keep it concise and don't write more than **50 characters** in the title.

:construction:
**For Work in Progress (WIP):** If you don’t want your PR to be merged accidentally, add the word "wip" or "WIP" to its title and the [WIP bot](https://github.com/apps/wip) will set its status to error.

---
>**Example for `Titles for work in progress (WIP):`**
>:point_right:WIP Contribution Guideline Improvement.:point_left:
---

:white_check_mark:
**Finalized Work:** If you are done with your work and want it to be merged, just write a descriptive title with no more than 50 characters.

---
>**Example for `Titles for Finalized Work:`**
>:point_right:Contribution Guideline Improvement.:point_left:

### <a name="4.2.5.2"></a> 4.2.5.2 How to Write a Description for a Pull Request.

We provide a [template](https://github.com/flyve-mdm/legacy-web-dashboard/community) for Pull Request descriptions. When you're creating a Pull Request it'll be shown automatically. Just fill it out and you're done.

### <a name="4.2.5.1"></a> 4.2.5.1 Additional Information.

:page_with_curl:
**Choose the right label**: Look at the [list of available labels.](https://github.com/flyve-mdm/legacy-web-dashboard/issues/labels)

### <a name="4.2.6"></a> 4.2.6 How to proceed with suggestions.

If we suggest changes then:
* Make the required updates.
* Re-run the Angular test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
* Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase develop -i
    git push -f
    ```
* Remove the WIP label.

# 5. <a name="5"></a> What to do next?

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete created-branch
    ```

* Check out the develop branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout develop -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D created-branch
    ```

* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```

# 6. <a name="6"></a> Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes must be [tested](#test-and-build) by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* All methods must be documented.


# Good luck! :tada:
